Todo Application.
Main part of it made on cource: Professional React Development.
I've made it's several steps myself due to course, such as: item-status-filter, deletion item and add-to-do-item-form.
All functional, which was made with teacher you can see there: https://github.com/Juriy/pro-react-redux/tree/master/todo/todo-final .

I've added more functions and components to make it similar to production app:
    1. added new components: ErrorBoundry, ErrorIndicator, LoadingIndicator (with hooks).


Plans:
    1. Save app data in Database (server / web db). 
    2. New functions on item: time to start/finish doing; change label.
    3. Add notification: when to start item, when it's 20 minutes remained or it's time to finish.
    4. Add customization for what time it's necessary to store done items.
